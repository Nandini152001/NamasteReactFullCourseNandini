1). Hello World using simple HTML
2). ................. JavaScript
3). ..................Using React

so, 1). Hello World using simple HTML.
____  inside simple html tags h1 or something.

2). using JS
___ writing h1 tag using JS then appending (using appendChild) to any div using it's ID (getDocumentByID).
as we know browser has JS Engine (browser's superpower) that knows all these methods.

<script>
      const heading = document.createElement("h1");
      heading.innerHTML = "Hello World from JavaScript!";

      const root = document.getElementById("root");
      root.appendChild(heading);
</script>

3)  Using React
___ way1). Use CDN links 
H.W.) CDN? -> Content Delivery Network
     (Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN):
      <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
      <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

H.W.) crossorigin -> what is crossorigin?

so what's exactly there in these links of CDN that is connecting our project to React.
Explore: 
https://unpkg.com/react18/umd/react.development.js
https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js

these are plain JS code and React is inside there

Ultimately React is a JS Library, right!

https://unpkg.com/react18/umd/react.development.js ---------it's core react thing.
https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js  ---- it's kind of bridge between React and browser.

//Basic Hello World program using React.

<div id="root"><div>
(simple div tag)

how to insert any tag inside this div tag without directly using html, but using React?
<script>
//three input React.createElement take --
//1st input is which tag want to create
//2nd is object
//3rd is what exactly want to show
// CREATING h1 element inside React
 	const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello React!");
//react wants to have a root where it should render the things or will do all DOM manipulation.
//PUT h1 Tag into DOM
 	const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementByID("root"));
	root.render(heading);

</script>
